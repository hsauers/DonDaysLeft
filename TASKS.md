# Agent Mode Tasks & Instructions

This file is a placeholder for tasks, ideas, and instructions to help you make full use of agent mode in this project.

## How to Use This File
- List tasks, enhancements, or bugs you want to address.
- Add instructions or requirements for features you want to implement.
- Use checklists to track progress.
- Reference specific files or code sections for clarity.

## Example Tasks
- [x] Add a dark mode toggle to the countdown page
- [x] Replace the image with a random image from the `img/` folder on each load
- [x] Add a sound effect when the countdown reaches zero
- [x] Improve mobile responsiveness

## Using Agent Mode with This Markdown
1. **Write Tasks Here:** Add your ideas, requirements, or bugs in this file.
2. **Ask the Agent:** Instruct the agent (like Copilot) to implement, fix, or enhance features based on the tasks listed here. For example:
   - "Implement the first unchecked task in TASKS.md."
   - "Add a feature as described in the 'Add a dark mode toggle' task."
3. **Iterate:** Review the changes, update the checklist, and add new tasks as needed.
4. **Documentation:** Use this file to document decisions, requirements, and progress for future reference.

## Example Agent Mode Workflow
1. Add a new task below.
2. Ask the agent to implement it.
3. Review the agent's changes.
4. Mark the task as complete.

## Ideas Parking Lot (Do Not Implement Unless Moved Above)
**Agents: Ignore this section. Only implement tasks that are listed above this line.**

The following are ideas for future improvements. To implement, copy the task to the main task list above:
- [ ] Add a settings panel to let users choose the countdown event date
- [ ] Allow users to upload their own images for the countdown
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements (e.g., ARIA labels, better color contrast)
